Hi! My name is Neel and I am currently a rising junior at the University of Maryland, studying Computer Science and Math. I am very passionate about finding ways that technology can be used responsibly and help the greatest number of people. My current interests include AI safety and evaluations.

Here's what I'm up to right now:

- Working as a **Data Engineering Intern** at [<u>Pacific Northwest National Lab](https://www.pnnl.gov/ai-and-data-analytics), working in the AI and Data Analytics Division.
- Continuing my position as a **Software Engineer** for [<u>Hack4Impact-UMD](https://umd.hack4impact.org/)
- Conducting research under Dr. Johan Larsson as part of the **Gemstone Honors Program**

Check out my [<u>Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neeljay/) for my full work history!

In my free time, I usually work out, play chess and watch soccer/football.
